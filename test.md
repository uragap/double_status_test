Of course we can't cover every change that has happened. So we reached out and
asked some of our teams what changes they are most proud of:

> For rustdoc, the big things were:
> * The automatically generated documentation for blanket implementations
> * The search itself and its optimizations (last one being to convert it into JSON)
> * The possibility to test more accurately doc code blocks "compile_fail,
>   should_panic, allow_fail"
> * Doc tests are now generated as their own seperate binaries.

> The release team has only been around since (roughly) early 2018, but even in
> that time, we've landed ~40000 commits just in rust-lang/rust without any
> significant regressions in stable.
>
> Considering how quickly we're improving the compiler and standard libraries, I
> think that's really impressive (though of course the release team is not the
> sole contributor here). Overall, I've found that the release team has done an
> excellent job of managing to scale to the increasing traffic on issue
> trackers, PRs being filed, etc.
